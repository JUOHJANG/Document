## 증상(SYMPTOM):
In MicroStrategy Enterprise Manager 10.x various errors or issues may occur when performing the Data Load including Primary Key Violation database errors, 
unexpected database locks, missing data from the Enterprise Manager tables, and other Data Load failures.

## 원인(CAUSE):
One potential cause for this behavior is having multiple Enterprise Manager services configured to access the same Enterprise Manager warehouse.  
The Enterprise Manager environment is designed to have one running service per warehouse.  
In this configuration, the single service will run Data Loads according to the schedules defined in the Enterprise Manager configuration and 
should not encounter any issues with Primary Key Violations or database locks since it will be the only database client performing the database operations.
If multiple Enterprise Manager services are configured to access the same Enterprise Manager warehouse, 
the services will not be aware of each other and will both attempt to run scheduled Data Loads at the same time according to the schedules defined. 
This can result in Data Load queries being run multiple times simultaneously which can cause query contention on the database, attempts to insert duplicate data, etc.

## 조치사항(ACTION):
Ensure that each Enterprise Manager warehouse has only a single Enterprise Manager service configured to access it. 
This may require particular attention when configuring an Intelligence Server cluster, as Configuration Wizard will attempt to automatically 
configure the Enterprise Manager service if a default Statistics repository is selected during Intelligence Server Configuration.
If the above query (or a similar one) returns multiple rows for the most recent time period, check the machines listed in the CLIENTMACHINE 
column to disable all Enterprise Manager services except for one.
